# Irem's Dice Game
AIN1001 First Homework Assignment - A Game for Two Players (06/11/2022)

Preamble

This is the first game I coded so it's very valuable to me. I can say the Turkish idiom "My first eye pain"

How to Play

There is a path starting with one and ending with one hundred.
The first player reaches square one hundred and wins the game.
There are two lucky squares and two penalty squares chosen by two players before the game begins.
When one player steps into one of the penalty squares, the player jumps ten squares back, and when the player steps into one of the lucky squares, the player jumps ten squares forward.
After the players select lucky and penalty squares, they start the game by rolling a six-sided dice and going forward accordingly.
